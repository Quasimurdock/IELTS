# IELTS Word List

## Appreciation
Thanks to the original repo [IELTS](https://github.com/fanhongtao/IELTS) for sharing a great vocabulary resource of IELTS learning.

## About
I just resolved the original word list text with regex to a purely "word list without anythin else". Yes, it only contains WORDS in the file `output.txt`. No definitions, phrases and examples, etc.

## How to use
1. install `node.js` and `pnpm`/`npm`
2. open your terminal
4. run `pnpm install` or `npm install`
3. run `pnpm start` or `npm start`
4. open `output.txt`
